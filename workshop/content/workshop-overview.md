# K8s Playground
This lab environment includes an integrated VSCode editor, an embedded octant dashboard and 2 terminals for your use.  

We have setup a fully functional K8s cluster for this lab using vCluster and you have full cluster-admin permissions on the vcluster kube context!

Have fun and learn k8s!
